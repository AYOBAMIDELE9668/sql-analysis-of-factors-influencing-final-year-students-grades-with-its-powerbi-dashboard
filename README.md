# SQL Analysis of Factors Influencing Final Year Students' Grades with its Power BI Dashboard

This project presents key insights derived from an analysis of academic performance data. The analysis covers student performance, teacher performance, and overall trends.

## **Overview of Key Findings**

- **Average CGPA:** The overall average CGPA is 3.42, indicating generally good academic performance.
- **Course Load:** The course load appears consistent across semesters, with no direct correlation to student performance.
- **Grade Distribution:** No students achieved First Class honors. The majority fall into the Second Class Lower category, with a significant portion in Second Class Upper.
- **Top Performing Courses:** Courses from the English department consistently score high. Psychology has the highest average CGPA, closely followed by English.
- **Failure Rate:** The course failure rate is relatively low, with a maximum of 11% for certain courses.

## **Student Analysis**

- **Age Distribution:** Most students are between 24 and 25 years old, with a few outliers.
- **Age and Performance:** A slight upward trend exists between age and CGPA, but it's not a strong indicator of performance. Factors like study habits, motivation, and department choice are likely more influential.
- **Gender and Performance:** No significant difference in average CGPA was observed between male and female students, suggesting gender doesn't significantly impact academic performance in this dataset.
- **Average Score by Credit Unit:** The average score per credit unit remains relatively consistent across different credit units.

## **Teacher Analysis**

- **Lecturer Performance:** A wide range of performance exists among lecturers, with some consistently high and others consistently lower.
- **Experience and Performance:** A slight positive correlation exists between experience (working years) and average score/CGPA, but it's not a strong determinant of student performance.
- **Designation and Performance:** Doctors and Professors tend to have slightly higher average scores and CGPA compared to Lecturers.

## **Implications and Further Analysis**

These insights provide a valuable overview of academic performance. Further analysis could explore:

- **Correlations:** Investigate correlations between study habits, motivation, and academic performance.
- **Intervention Strategies:** Develop targeted interventions for underperforming students or courses.
- **Lecturer Development Programs:** Implement programs to support lecturers with lower performance ratings.
- **Impact of Teaching Methods:** Analyze the impact of different teaching methodologies on student outcomes.

## **Key Recommendations**

These recommendations are categorized for clarity:

### **Factors Beyond Demographics**
- **Consider External Factors:** Shift the focus from static demographics like age and gender to more impactful factors such as study habits, motivation, economic conditions, and department choice.

### **Student Support**
- **Student Support:** Implement robust support systems, including tutoring, counseling, and additional resources, specifically targeting students underperforming in certain courses.

### **Curriculum and Assessment**
- **Flexible Curriculum:** Review and adapt the curriculum to cater to diverse student needs and learning styles, promoting inclusivity and personalized learning.
- **Syllabus Coverage:** Ensure lecturers thoroughly cover the entire syllabus to adequately prepare students for assessments.
- **Exam Question Alignment:** Verify that exam questions directly align with the taught syllabus to ensure fair and accurate assessments.

### **Feedback and Evaluation**
- **Student Feedback Mechanisms:** Establish effective channels for students to provide feedback on teaching, courses, and their overall academic experience.
- **Lecturer Evaluation:** Implement a comprehensive lecturer evaluation system to assess teaching effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and provide targeted training and support.

### **Faculty and Teaching Practices**
- **Workload Management:** Adjust the course load for inexperienced lecturers, especially those with lower performance ratings, to allow for adequate preparation and delivery of quality teaching.
- **Faculty Development:** Offer ongoing professional development opportunities for faculty to enhance their teaching skills and stay up-to-date with the latest educational trends.
- **Technology Integration:** Integrate technology tools to enhance teaching and learning, including online resources, interactive tools, and virtual classrooms.
- **Student Engagement Strategies:** Employ active learning techniques, group projects, and hands-on activities to foster student engagement, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
