# sql-analysis-of-factors-influencing-final-year-students-grades-with-its-powerbi-dashboard
This project presents key insights derived from an analysis of academic performance data. The analysis covers student performance, teacher performance, and overall trends.
**Overview of Key Findings**
Average CGPA: The overall average CGPA is 3.42, indicating generally good academic performance.
Course Load: The course load appears consistent across semesters, with no direct correlation to student performance.
Grade Distribution: No students achieved First Class honors. The majority fall into the Second Class Lower category, with a significant portion in Second Class Upper.
Top Performing Courses: Courses from the English department consistently score high. Psychology has the highest average CGPA, closely followed by English.
Failure Rate: The course failure rate is relatively low, with a maximum of 11% for certain courses.
Student Analysis
Age Distribution: Most students are between 24 and 25 years old, with a few outliers.
Age and Performance: A slight upward trend exists between age and CGPA, but it's not a strong indicator of performance. Factors like study habits, motivation, and department choice are likely more influential.
Gender and Performance: No significant difference in average CGPA was observed between male and female students, suggesting gender doesn't significantly impact academic performance in this dataset.
Average Score by Credit Unit: The average score per credit unit remains relatively consistent across different credit units.
Teacher Analysis
Lecturer Performance: A wide range of performance exists among lecturers, with some consistently high and others consistently lower.
Experience and Performance: A slight positive correlation exists between experience (working years) and average score/CGPA, but it's not a strong determinant of student performance.
Designation and Performance: Doctors and Professors tend to have slightly higher average scores and CGPA compared to Lecturers.
Implications and Further Analysis
These insights provide a valuable overview of academic performance. Further analysis could explore:

Correlations: Investigate correlations between study habits, motivation, and academic performance.
Intervention Strategies: Develop targeted interventions for underperforming students or courses.
Lecturer Development Programs: Implement programs to support lecturers with lower performance ratings.
Impact of Teaching Methods: Analyze the impact of different teaching methodologies on student outcomes.
